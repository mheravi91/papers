## Summary

Stroke and accident survivors often lose shoulder mobility, but many rehabilitation exoskeletons stay confined to clinics. This paper introduces a portable five-degree-of-freedom wearable robot tailored for in-home physiotherapy sessions. The mechanism adapts to different body sizes, and the control loop leverages surface electromyography to modulate assistance while enforcing user safety.

## Technical highlights

- Adjustable 5-DOF kinematic design balances shoulder coverage with donning convenience for everyday use.
- EMG-driven proportional control algorithm modulates actuation support in real time while enforcing safety limits.
- Prototype integrates compact actuators, on-board sensing, and embedded electronics in a form factor suitable for domestic environments.

## Evaluation snapshot

- Single-subject home-therapy case study covering 15 sessions.
- Shoulder range of motion increased from 20° pre-therapy to 75° post-programme using the portable device.
- Demonstrated feasibility of conducting supervised physiotherapy outside lab settings.
