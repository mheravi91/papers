## Abstract

The excavation process introduces complex, fast-changing rock motion that conventional empirical models fail to capture. We propose a hybrid framework that embeds Newtonian constraints into a neural surrogate trained on sequences generated by a high-fidelity digital twin. The physics guidance stabilises inference, enabling accurate generalisation to unseen soil compositions while maintaining real-time performance.

## Highlights

- Six-degree-of-freedom motion estimation that remains stable under sparse sensor coverage.
- Residual physics terms regularise the neural surrogate, preventing error accumulation during long excavation runs.
- Synthetic-but-validated trajectories from the simulator accelerate training without disrupting operations in the field.

## Method at a glance

1. Calibrate a high-fidelity simulator using limited on-site measurements.
2. Generate trajectory batches spanning changes in soil composition, tool geometry, and motion profiles.
3. Train a hybrid neural network that enforces rigid-body constraints through differentiable physics losses.
4. Deploy the surrogate on edge hardware for live excavation monitoring and planning.

## Results

- Mean absolute error drops by **37%** over empirical baselines on challenging excavation cycles.
- Model retains accuracy when sensors fail temporarily thanks to temporal consistency constraints.
- Inference latency stays below **28 ms**, supporting closed-loop control.
